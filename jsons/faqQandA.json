For example, if the loan amount is 5000, it may be divided into 2000, 2000, 500, 500. Now keep in mind that, it might also get divided into some other amount. But those amouts must be a divisible of 500 and sums up the loan amount. Then our system will fetch the lenders who has more money than those distributed amounts. Then it will deduct those money from the lenders and add it to the borrower's wallet. That's how our system works.",
